# Powerball

Did you buy a bluetooth Gyroscopic PowerBall from AliExpress or some other similar website? Did 
it come with a funky QR code on one side, and no other instructions? Did you spend a lot of time 
searching what to do and discover that you need to use WeChat to actually use the BT functionality 
of your PowerBall? Do you not want to use WeChat but still want to use the BT features? This is 
the repo for you!

The code here basically reverse engineers the BT protocol used by the PowerBall and displays 
everything the WeChat app probably does, without the data privacy violations.

## Usage

Build the project:
```
cd android
./gradlew build
```

Install the apk on your android device:
```
